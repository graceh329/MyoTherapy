# MyoTherapy

Perhaps some of the most common injuries involve the hand, arm, and wrist. With thousands of Americans affected by these conditions every year, it is important for those people to receive proper treatment. However, with rising healthcare costs, it is becoming increasingly difficult for those affected to have access to these medical specialists. We were motivated to provide a more affordable option that is quick and trackable in order to aid in recovery.

MyoTherapy uses the Myo Armband to guide users through a series of exercises to rehabilitate and track their progress.
